Add a simple pride strip at the top of your website or UI element.

## Pride bar
You can also add a pride bar across the top of any element by using the class `pride-bar` on that element.
This gives the element a `margin: 0` and adds the bar using background border `:before` the element.

For example, we have have a `.pride-bar` on the body tag: `<body class="pride-bar">`.

## Pride strip

You can also add a pride bar across the top of any element by using the class `pride-bar` div as the first child in that div.
This may be preferable if you do not want to modify margins, or you want to apply the style to a child element within a page (such as this sample div).
