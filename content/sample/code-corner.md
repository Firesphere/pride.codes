Add a simple "Pride Codes" corner to your website.

To add the Code Corner just paste this script tag at the end of your `body`:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://pride.codes/js/codecorner.js"></script>
```


Want to host it yourself? Sure! Just download [the source](https://github.com/devjack/pride.codes) `codecorner.js` file, and include it like any other script file.
