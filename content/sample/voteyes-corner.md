<!--more-->

To add the corner just paste in this script tag and we handle the rest. The #VoteYes corner comes in two variants depending on the design of your website (left aligned, or right aligned.)

To add the **right** aligned corner paste this script tag at the end of your `body`:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://pride.codes/js/voteyes.js"></script>
```

To add the **left** aligned corner paste this script tag at the end of your `body`:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://pride.codes/js/voteyes-left.js"></script>
```

Want to host it yourself? Sure! Just download [the source](https://github.com/devjack/pride.codes) `voteyes.js` or `voteyes-left.js` file, and include it like any other script file.
