# About

[pride.codes](https://pride.codes) is a collection of simple web widgets that allow you to show your support for marriage equality and the LGBTIQ communnity.

If you have a website with an Australian audience please add a Vote Yes corner. Our code is [open source](https://github.com/devjack/pride.codes/), so feel free to play around with it - we welcome all feedback!

In the near future, [pride.codes](https://pride.codes) will be a hub of information and resources for Australian LGBTIQ tech workers, employers and supporters, if you're interested in helping us, please get in touch.
