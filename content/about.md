# About

[pride.codes](https://pride.codes) is a collection of simple web widgets that allow you to show your support for marriage equality and the LGBTIQ community. We want to help technologists worldwide fly the rainbow flag and make the internet a brighter place.

If you have a website with an Australian audience we'd love it if you added a "#VoteYes" pride corner for the next few months. Our code is [MIT licensed](https://github.com/devjack/pride.codes/) and we'd love your contributions and feedback.

[pride.codes](https://pride.codes) is here to celebrate the LGBTQI+ community. If you're an engineering or software development company, flying the rainbow flag means that you're standing side by ide with your colleagues and friends.

Want to help out? You can [tweet us](https://www.twitter.com/pridecodes) or find us on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/devjack/pride.codes).
