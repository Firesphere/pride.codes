## Pride Corner

To add the corner just paste in this script tag and we handle the rest. The #VoteYes corner comes in two variants depending on the design of your website (left aligned, or right aligned.)

To add the **right** aligned corner paste this script tag at the end of your `body`:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://pride.codes/js/voteyes.js"></script>
```

To add the **left** aligned corner paste this script tag at the end of your `body`:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://pride.codes/js/voteyes-left.js"></script>
```

Want to host it yourself? Sure! Just download [the source](https://github.com/devjack/pride.codes) `voteyes.js` or `voteyes-left.js` file, and include it like any other script file.

## Pride bar

You can also add a pride bar across the top of any element by using the class `pride-bar` on that element.
This gives the element a `margin: 0` and adds the bar using background border `:before` the element.

For example, we have have a `.pride-bar` on the body tag: `<body class="pride-bar">`.

## Pride strip

You can also add a pride bar across the top of any element by using the class `pride-bar` div as the first child in that div.
This may be preferable if you do not want to modify margins, or you want to apply the style to a child element within a page (such as this sample div).
